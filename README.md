# NimCurse

**NimCurse** is an experimental terminal UI rendering engine built on [Notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses), designed for high-performance, shader-inspired visuals in text-based environments.

---

## Vision

- Built on Notcurses for high performance terminal rendering
- Scriptable UI logic via embedded Lua (optional)
- Native support for layered glyph effects and pixel-like precision
- Experimental support for custom animation loops and “shader-like” draw cycles
- Minimalist API surface: focus on frames, effects, and control
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows via WSL)

## Status

This is still in concept stage.
